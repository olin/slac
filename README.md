Agenda and projects for October 23:

## Projects that need help

* [**Guess the Oliner:**](http://www.olinapps.com/directory/guess/) Sort male / female names to make guessing harder.
* [**Dining Menu:**](http://www.olinapps.com/dining/) Can you make this an interactive nutrition calculator? Maybe check boxes to tally what food you'd get in a given day. Check out <http://www.olinapps.com/api/dining/olin/nutrition> for extended nutrition information.
* [**Launchpad:**](http://www.olinapps.com/launchpad)  a true "Olin homepage". What does that look like?
* [**Olin Projects.com:**](http://www.olinprojects.com/projects/) How can you make this more useful? Like something every Oliner uses and every blog on the internet links to, etc.
* [**Guess the Oliner:**](http://www.olinapps.com/directory/guess/) You can scrape high-quality images from the handbook pictures, but how? Or is there a better way to get images for every Oliner? A simpler way?
* [**StoryQuilt:**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roomates.storyquilt) Collaborative story making with barely any context? Improve + webapp.
* **Design your own major (HALP)**! Ask Aman Kapur if he needs help.
